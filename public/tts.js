/**
 * This module provides a simple, browser-based text-to-speech function called speakText.
 * When called with a string of text, it uses the Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesisUtterance 
 * to convert that text into spoken audio. It also allows optional customization of the 
 * voice used (if the userâ€™s device/browser supports multiple voices) and the speed of 
 * speech using the rate parameter. The function first checks if the browser supports 
 * speech synthesis, and if not, it logs a warning. If a voice name is provided, it 
 * searches the available voices and applies the selected one. Finally, it instructs 
 * the browser to speak the text aloud, making this function suitable for accessibility 
 * features, reading content to users, or enhancing applications with voice feedback.
